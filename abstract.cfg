%从这里开始写你的摘要，分段需要空一行。
高考志愿填报是中国的每位高中生不可忽视的人生重要选择，而对于许多学生，尤其是来自经济和教育水平不高的地区的学生，他们将大部分的精力都放在如何考好试上，而对于志愿填报不甚了解。如果没有得到好的指导，一位学生可能会因为信息不对称而在志愿填报上吃亏，没有进入一个符合自己分数的学校，甚至被退档以至无学可上，这会是一个很大的遗憾。因此，在高考结束后，帮助学生完成一个好的志愿选择是一项普惠性的、符合应试教育国情的工作。本毕业设计将致力于开发一个能够充分照顾学生的需求、推荐算法合理、信息全面而准确、精简无累赘而又易于使用的高招志愿填报辅助系统，建设一个能够为广大考生和家长分忧的设施。

本志愿填报辅助网站的开发过程使用了前后端分离的形式，采用Django3.2作为框架、Python语言作为编程语言、PyCharm2021.3作为编辑器进行后端的开发，采用Vue3作为框架、HTML, CSS, Javascript语言作为编程语言、Visual Studio Code作为编辑器进行前端开发，使用MySQL数据库进行数据的管理，并使用Nginx进行反向代理搭建。网站的结构分为用户界面和管理员界面两个部分。管理员可以对用户、文章、院校资料等数据进行浏览及更改，而用户可以浏览院校资料库并进行定向查询、根据自己的成绩进行录取可能性的分析、模拟志愿填报，以及浏览各类新闻信息等。

本文将详细地对该网站的开发过程以及实现的功能进行介绍，包括整体构思、开发环境、各大模块的功能及开发过程等。

% ABSTRACT

%Your abstract here, to make a new paragraph, give an extra blank line please.
The college entrance examination is an important choice in the life of every high school student in China that cannot be ignored, and for many students, especially those from areas with low economic and educational levels, they focus most of their energy on how to do well on the exams and do not know much about filling applications. Without good guidance, a student may lose out on applications due to information asymmetry, not getting into a school that matches his or her score, or even being dropped or even having no school to go to, which can be a big regret. Therefore, helping students to complete a good application selection after the college entrance examination is a universal and in line with the national situation of test-based education. This graduation design will be devoted to developing a high school entrance examination application assistance system that can fully take care of students' needs, a reasonable recommendation algorithm, comprehensive and accurate information, streamlined and non-cumbersome but easy to use, and building a facility that can share the worries of the majority of candidates and parents.

The development process of this volunteer application assistance website uses the form of front-end and back-end separation, using Django3.2 as the framework, Python language as the programming language, PyCharm2021.3 as the editor for the back-end development, using Vue3 as the framework, HTML, CSS, Javascript language as the programming language, Visual Studio Code as the editor for front-end development, MySQL database for data management, and Nginx for reverse proxy construction. The structure of the website is divided into two parts: user interface and administrator interface. The administrator can browse and change data such as users, articles, and college information, while users can browse the college database and make targeted inquiries, analyze the possibility of admission based on their scores, simulate filling applications, and browse various news and information.

In this paper, we will introduce the development process of the website and its functions in detail, including the overall concept, development environment, functions of major modules and development process.
